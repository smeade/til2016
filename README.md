# TIL

> Today I Learned

Notes to myself and development team-mates. Very short description of things I learn regarding techonologies, languages and development best practices. Largely things I learned from other developers and snippets of online documentation.

Idea copied from and inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)
